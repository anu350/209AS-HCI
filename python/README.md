# Custom ML API

Later we can try calling tf.js directly from the browser.
But for faster development we should have full connection with a python backend.
Afterwards we can also consider MLaaS stuff.

## api.py

- Exposes a few routes with possible requests.
- Only send note info when needed

## Missing

- Implementation of question generation + tag generation
- interaction with database

## Extra stuff

- for development, we can expose the local python api with ngrok.io
